**Designing Software**

My approach to designing software revolves around understanding the user's needs and the context in which the software will be used. This involves a blend of user research, and iterative design. The design of the 3D scene in the project was a clear reflection of this approach, focusing on familiarity and relatability for users by simulating a typical computer workspace. The skills honed during this project include detailed object design, lighting mechanics, and environmental design. For the project, I followed a step-by-step process that started with brainstorming the objects essential to a workspace scene and then iterating on their designs for realism. 

**Developing Programs**

My approach to developing programs is methodical. I start with an outline of what the software should achieve. This is followed by modular code development, ensuring each function serves a singular purpose. Working on the 3D scene was a testament to this approach. I introduced new development strategies, such as integrating the GLFW library for seamless navigation and modularly defining functions like processInput, mouseCallback, and scrollCallback for organized code. Iterative development was crucial, as with each test, tweaks were made to enhance realism, lighting, and user experience. This iterative process ensured that the end product was polished and user-friendly.

**Computer Science and Future Goals**

Computer science is a dynamic field that constantly equips me with tools and knowledge to solve real-world problems. Computational graphics and visualizations, for instance, offer a tangible way to represent data, ideas, or simulations, making them accessible and understandable to a broader audience. As I progress in my education, these skills will be invaluable, especially in research or collaborative projects where visual aids can simplify complex concepts. Professionally, the knowledge gained from computational graphics will be instrumental, especially in industries like game development, animation, or any field that requires a blend of aesthetics and functionality.
